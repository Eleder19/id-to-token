Converts a discord user ID to the first part of their token.

Discord tokens are made up of 3 parts and each part is seperated with a dot (.)


First part is the user ID encoded in Base64.


Second part is the timestamp of when the account was created or timestamp of when the password was changed.


And the third part is very sensitive, do not share it with anyone!


This program encodes a given user ID into the first part of their token
